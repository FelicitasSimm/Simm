       <p>Starting from Scratch </p>
    </article>
   


    <article class="article_body1">
  <p> For a beginner, which one comes first. Hard work tops the list. It is different from an 
    established videographer. Planning is their first agenda they as they navigate the world of 
    award recognition within the industry. Blood and sweat. You might well say as videographers 
    of calibre or novice, still has to go through human perseverance.
</p>
<p>
    Recognition only comes after the substantial rolls of video works had come through working 
    with known artists or corporate brand names. Getting involved with Anna Blatman, a local 
    artist here in Australia, gives someone a leap as she goes through her painting of so 
    called ‘No technique’. She came to admit that her painting is of nothing perfect yet the 
    outcome is truly amazing.
</p>
<p>
    Videography is similar to Anna’s world of ‘No Technique’ style of painting.

    Experimentation comes as part of the trade. Having a keen eye to be able to overcome 
    the shortfall caused by either the camera equipment or the man behind the shots as
    reflected on the footages taken.
</p>
<p>
    The colour between the many shoots don’t match. Of course, this would happen as shoots take
    place in many locations on different weather conditions. Also, there is the time of the day 
    to take into consideration when the lenses started to roll.
</p>
<p>
    The most important factor is human effort. The camera man’s ability to take advantage of the 
    location and his equipment are within his control on most occasions. Yet at the end of the day, 
    the end result is out of his control. He could only do his best while shooting the actors at play. 
</p>
    The hours of watching video footages can be fun. At times, it could be frustrating as the 
    elements need to shine out of dull settings. That is the main job of a videographer. 
    Make a video leap and grab on to the audience. Sneak into their bedroom and accompany
    them into their slumbered sleep. 
</p>
<p>
    In honesty, planning and hard work comes hand in hand. To see vividly the end product do require
    forethought and working out how the video is to presented to the public. Hours or replays comes 
    as the videographer need lateral thinking of which way the videotapes can be shorten as to the 
    requirements of the clients.
</p> 
<p>
    Common to the industry is that the videographer does not work alone. At times, he is just 
    commissioned to come up with the finished video. There is the director who overlooks the
    entire project and does the video shooting himself. Or at times, there is the outsourcing 
    for a camera man.
</p>
<p>
    Camera equipment whether owned or not should meet the standard requirement of the output 
    video. They don’t come cheap though running in tens of thousands or topping the hundreds 
    of thousands.
</p>   
<p>
    If you are interested in videography, then you soon find out the cost of video equipment and 
    accessories. Pricing has come down though with camera brands outdoing or perhaps the word is
    outperforming one another trying to capture the market of downsized cameras suitable for
    commercial application.
